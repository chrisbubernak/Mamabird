Wow, what a year for our program. Not only did the A team win three spring tournaments on the road to the National Championship, our B team (Cockfight) grew out of control, held seed at Regionals and a C team (Baby Bird) was born. We are all excited about tryouts next year. Thank you to all our fans that came out to Mason, OH and the ones watching online! The sideline support was tremendous. Couldn’t have done it without y’all.
