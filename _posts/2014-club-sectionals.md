Mamabird will be sending a fresh college squad into the beaks and talons of the local club teams at Rocky Mountain Open Club Sectionals, 2014, on the weekend of Sept 6-7 at

Dick's Sporting Goods Park

This is after the second week of Fall semester and one week of team practices. This is a great opportunity for new tryouts for the team to play with veterans who have not been playing on local club teams over the summer and to experience the very highest level of ultimate that is being played in our sport. Also a great way for you vets who have been away for the summer to get back together and re-learn our system.
