Mamabird traveled to Stanford, CA this weekend to compete at the Stanford Invite. Excessive rain at Stanford caused the tournament to be moved to backup field sites in Stevinson (a 2 hour drive). Mamabird came out hot on Saturday rolling through their pool and posted an impressive 3-0 record despite heavy winds. Unfortuantely on Sunday Mamabird ran into a UNC team hitting their stride and fell 12-13.
