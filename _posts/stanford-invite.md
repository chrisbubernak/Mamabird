Mamabird traveled to Stanford, CA this weekend to compete at the Stanford Invite. Excessive rain at Stanford caused the tournament to be moved to backup field sites in Stevinson (a 2 hour drive). Mamabird came out hot on Saturday rolling through their pool and posted an impressive 3-0 record taking down UCSD, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Despite the heavy winds Mamabird was able to play efficiently and scored 13 goals in two of the three games (a rare feat given the wind).

On Sunday Mamabird found themselves matched up against a talented UNC squad in what would be a hotly contested quarterfinals matchup featuring the top two teams in the country. UNC came out strong in the first half, and after capitalizing on a myriad of Mamabird mistakes, were able to build an 8-4 halftime lead that seemed insurmountable in the wind.

Despite the conditions Mamabird was able to fight back in the second half with some junky zone looks and tied up the score late in the game at 11-11. Unfortunately, the combination of ill-timed turnovers and patient upwind offense by UNC spelled trouble for Mamabird who wound up falling 12-13. The weekend ended with an emotionally drained Mamabird team falling to Stanford in consolation 12-15. Full results can be found [here]( http://scorereport.net/2014/college-open/event14098).
